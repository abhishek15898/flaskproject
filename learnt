Why to use relationship?
We have 2 models here - Project and Guide.
If no relationship:
  If I would like to render the name of the guide for a project then:
    I will need to create a query that selects the projects of a particular guide using the foreign key - guide_id
    Then I will have to pass the query in the template.
    OR
    I will have to pass all the guides and projects in to the templates.
With relationship:
  I dont need to query anything. I will simply have to pass the project into the template and
  use the relationship project.mentor.name to display the name of the mentor.
  The relationship actually binds the foreign key with the primary key.
